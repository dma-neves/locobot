**you\>** what does tinysm library offer?


**locobot\>** The TinySM (Tiny State Machine) library is a C++ implementation of state machines. It provides a simple and efficient way to model and manage complex behaviors in software applications.

Some key features offered by the TinySM library include:

1. **State Machine Model**: The library provides a basic state machine class `event` that allows you to define states, transitions, and events.
2. **Event Grouping**: The library also includes an event group class `event_group`, which enables you to create groups of related events and manage them efficiently.
3. **Transition Management**: The library provides functions to add, remove, and manage state transitions, including the ability to specify trigger conditions and callbacks.
4. **State Callbacks**: The library offers a way to attach callbacks to states, allowing developers to perform actions when entering or exiting a state.
5. **Event Triggering**: The library enables event triggering, which allows events to be triggered automatically based on specific conditions.

The TinySM library is designed to be flexible and extensible, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including game development, simulation modeling, and more.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the basic usage of the TinySM library:
```cpp
#include <tinysm>

int main() {
    // Create a state machine with initial state 'A'
    tinysm tsm('A', {{std::make_tuple('A', 'B')}, {std::make_tuple('C', 'D')}}, 
               {{{'enter_A'}}, {{'exit_B'}}});

    // Create an event group
    event_group<tsm> eg;

    // Add events to the event group
    tsm.add_transition({std::make_tuple('A', 'B'), {}});  // Transition from A to B
    tsm.add_transition({std::make_tuple('C', 'D'), {}});  // Transition from C to D

    // Trigger the event group
    eg.trigger();

    return 0;
}
```
This example demonstrates how to create a state machine, add transitions, and trigger an event group.


**you\>** how can I use it to simulate a traffic light?


**locobot\>** To simulate a traffic light using the TinySM library, you'll need to create states and transitions that model the different phases of the traffic light. Here's an example implementation:

```cpp
#include <tinysm>

int main() {
    // Create the initial state: "Red"
    tinysm<State> tsm("Red", {{std::make_tuple(State, State), event<State>}};

    // Define the transitions:
    //   - Red -> Yellow (with a transition trigger that waits for 5 seconds)
    //   - Yellow -> Green (with a transition trigger that waits for 10 seconds)
    //   - Green -> Red (with an exit callback to reset the timer)

    tsm.add_transition(std::make_tuple(State, State), event<State>{["trigger"] = []() {
        std::cout << "Traffic light is turning yellow." << std::endl;
        return true;
    }});

    tsm.add_transition(std::make_tuple(Yellow, State), event<State>{["trigger"] = []() {
        std::cout << "Traffic light is turning green." << std::endl;
        return true;
    }});

    tsm.add_transition(std::make_tuple(Green, State), event<State>{["trigger"] = []() {
        std::cout << "Traffic light is turning red." << std::endl;
        return true;
    }});

    // Set the initial timer for the Red state
    auto red_timer = timer<RedState>(Duration::seconds(10));

    // Create a new instance of the traffic light simulator
    tinysm tsm;

    // Run the simulation
    bool running = true;
    while (running) {
        if (tsm.is_in_state(State)) {
            std::cout << "Traffic light is red." << std::endl;
            red_timer.start();
        } else if (tsm.is_in_state(Yellow)) {
            std::cout << "Traffic light is yellow." << std::endl;
            timer<YellowState>(Duration::seconds(5)).start();
        } else if (tsm.is_in_state(Green)) {
            std::cout << "Traffic light is green." << std::endl;
            timer<GreenState>(Duration::seconds(10)).start();
        }

        // Update the state based on the current timer
        tsm.state_ = red_timer.current() < Duration::seconds(5) ? RedState : (red_timer.current() < Duration::seconds(15) ? YellowState : GreenState);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example creates a traffic light simulator with three states: "Red", "Yellow", and "Green". The transitions are defined such that the state changes when the timer reaches a certain threshold (5 seconds for yellow, 10 seconds for green). The exit callback is used to reset the timer when the state changes.

Please note that this example assumes you have already set up the TinySM library and the necessary headers are included. Also, `State`, `RedState`, `YellowState`, and `GreenState` are placeholder classes that represent each state in the traffic light simulator. These classes should be defined separately to make the code compile.

Also note that this example uses a very simplified approach to simulate the traffic light. You may need to add more complexity, such as handling multiple lights or cars at different intersections.
